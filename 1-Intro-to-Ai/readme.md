# GPT : Generative Pre-trained Transformer

- GPT is a generative pre-trained transformer model.
- GPT is a transformer-based language model trained on vast amounts of text data.
- GPT is trained on a large corpus of text data, and it can generate text based on the input text.

# TRANSFORMER : Transformer is a deep learning model that is used for natural language processing (NLP).

- Build by Google
- Transformer is a deep learning model that is used for natural language processing (NLP).
- Transformer takes some input and transforms its to something else.
- Transformers is designed for developers and machine learning engineers and researchers.

## Features

- Transformers provides everything you need for inference or training with state-of-the-art pretrained models. Some of the main features include:

1. Pipeline: Simple and optimized inference class for many machine learning tasks like text generation, image segmentation, automatic speech recognition, document question answering, and more.

2. Trainer: A comprehensive trainer that supports features such as mixed precision, torch.compile, and FlashAttention for training and distributed training for PyTorch models.

3. generate: Fast text generation with large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), including support for streaming and multiple decoding strategies.


### Transformer Architecture

- It starts from an input, processes it through multiple layers of attention and feed-forward neural networks, and produces an output.

- The key components of the transformer architecture are:
 
- Tokenization: The input text is divided into smaller units called tokens.
- Embedding: Each token is converted into a high-dimensional vector representation.
- https://projector.tensorflow.org/ is a tool that allows you to visualize high-dimensional data, such as word embeddings, in a lower-dimensional space.

# Transformer
 - Training Phase : 
   - The model is trained on a large dataset of text.
- Inferencing Phase :
   - The trained model is used to generate text based on the input text.
