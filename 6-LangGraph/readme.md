# LangGraph

** LangGraph is a part of LangChainJS that allows you to create and manage stateful workflows using a graph-based approach. It enables you to define nodes and transitions between them, making it easier to build complex applications that require maintaining state across multiple interactions.

- go through <https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/install>
- we have to build our first agent using LangGraph, then we have to call LLM
- <https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/openai>
- <https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/workflows-agents>
- <https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/agents>
- install zod for schema validation

## NOTE: I know the code ie. graph.js feels overwhelming, but don't worry in next upcoming chapter[7-Agent-SDK] we will be studying [OPENAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs) that will make our life easier to build agents
